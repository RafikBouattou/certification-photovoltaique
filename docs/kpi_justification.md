# Justification of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## 1. Introduction

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential for evaluating the performance and health of photovoltaic (PV) systems. They provide a standardized way to measure and compare the efficiency of different sites. This document justifies the custom KPIs used in our project and compares them with the industry-standard IEC 61724.

## 2. Custom KPIs

Our project uses seven custom KPIs to provide a granular analysis of the electrical behavior of a PV site:

- **DC Voltage Stability:** Measures the stability of the DC voltage, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the inverter.
- **AC Voltage Balance:** Assesses the balance between the three phases of the AC voltage, which is important for grid stability.
- **AC Current Harmony:** Detects anomalies in the AC current, which can indicate problems with the inverter or the grid.
- **AC Frequency Stability:** Monitors the stability of the AC frequency, which is a key indicator of grid health.
- **Power Factor:** Measures the efficiency of the power transmission.
- **Generation-Irradiance Ratio:** Compares the generated power with the available solar irradiance to assess the overall efficiency of the system.
- **Temporal Variability:** Tracks the variability of the power output over time, which can indicate intermittency issues.

These KPIs provide a detailed view of the electrical performance of a PV site and can be used to detect a wide range of faults and anomalies.

## 3. IEC 61724 Standard and Performance Ratio (PR)

The IEC 61724 standard defines a set of KPIs for monitoring the performance of PV systems. The most important of these is the Performance Ratio (PR), which is a measure of the overall efficiency of a PV system.

The PR is calculated as the ratio of the final yield (the actual energy produced) to the reference yield (the theoretical energy that could have been produced). It is a valuable metric for comparing the performance of different PV systems, as it is independent of the specific location and weather conditions.

## 4. Comparison

Our custom KPIs and the IEC 61724 standard are complementary. The IEC 61724 standard provides a high-level view of the overall performance of a PV system, while our custom KPIs provide a more granular view of the electrical behavior of the system.

**Strengths of our custom KPIs:**
- They provide a more detailed view of the electrical performance of a PV system.
- They can be used to detect a wider range of faults and anomalies.
- They are more sensitive to subtle changes in the performance of a PV system.

**Weaknesses of our custom KPIs:**
- They are not as standardized as the IEC 61724 KPIs.
- They are more difficult to interpret for non-experts.

## 5. Conclusion

Our custom KPIs are a valuable addition to the IEC 61724 standard. They provide a more detailed view of the electrical performance of a PV system and can be used to detect a wider range of faults and anomalies. We recommend using our custom KPIs in conjunction with the IEC 61724 standard to get a complete picture of the performance of a PV system.
